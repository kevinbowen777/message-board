message-board
=============

The message-board_ project is an simple text posting application that allows
users to post to a shared feed list.

This application allows users to log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.

This web application is built using the Django 5.1.x web application framework and is part of the collection of `Web Framework Projects`_ .
